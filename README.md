# Dark Noise for Mac Beta

Since we still don't have TestFlight for Mac I'm trying out distributing a beta build of my upcoming Mac Catalyst version of Dark Noise using GitHub... we'll see how this goes! ðŸ˜„

To download the app, go to [Releases](https://github.com/charliemchapman/dark-noise-mac-beta/releases) and download the dark-noise-macos.zip file under Assets.
